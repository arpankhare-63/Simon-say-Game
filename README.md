# Simon Says Game

## Overview
The Simon Says Game is a classic memory game where players must repeat a sequence of colors and sounds in the correct order. The sequence gets progressively longer, challenging the player's memory and focus. This implementation is built using HTML, JavaScript, and CSS, running entirely in the browser.

## Features
- **Interactive Gameplay**: Click or tap colored buttons to repeat the sequence.
- **Increasing Difficulty**: Each round adds a new step to the sequence.
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile devices.
- **Game Over Screen**: Displays when the player makes a mistake, with an option to restart.

## How to Play
1. Press the "Start" button to begin the game.
2. Watch and listen to the sequence of colors that light up and play sounds.
3. Repeat the sequence by clicking the colored buttons in the same order.
4. If you get the sequence correct, the game adds a new step and continues.
5. If you make a mistake, the game ends, and you can restart.

## Installation
1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
3. No additional dependencies or setup are required, as the game uses vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
